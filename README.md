#### How to Play? - *Discord*
  Once when you start a match, get to dms to play. It is played in dms cause the numbers are supposed to be hidden...
  The bowler bowls a ball by typing a number , the batsman hits the ball by typing a number. If both the numbers are same, it is a Wicket and the batsman changes else the batsman's number adds to his score, and after wicket, the next innings starts with a target that the previous batsman has hit in total.
  The batsman and bowler in first innings gets swapped their position. Now the batsman(i.e the bowler in innings 1) has to chase the bowler's(i.e. batsman in innings 1) score.
  If the batsman and the bowler type the same number before the target score is reached by the batsman, bolwer wins, else if the batsman crosses the target, batsman wins.
